# üß™ Network Segmentation Lab: Zero Trust Implementation for TechNova Solutions

## üìò Scenario Overview

You‚Äôve been hired as a **network security intern** at **TechNova Solutions**, a mid-sized IT consulting company. TechNova is transitioning to a **Zero Trust security model** to improve internal network segmentation and protect against insider threats and external attacks.

Your goal: **Design and implement VLAN segmentation, firewall rules, and security monitoring on a virtualized pfSense firewall.**


## üè¢ Company Network Structure

The company network includes the following components:

- **Employee Devices** ‚Äì Corporate LAN  
- **Guest Wi-Fi** ‚Äì For visitors and contractors  
- **IoT Devices** ‚Äì Smart printers, security cameras, etc.  
- **Servers** ‚Äì File servers, internal applications, databases  
- **Management Network** ‚Äì Used by admins and IT operations


## üìã Lab Requirements

### 1. üîÄ Network Segmentation (VLANs)

Create separate VLANs for each network type:

| VLAN | Network Type      | VLAN ID |
|------|-------------------|---------|
| 10   | Employee LAN      | VLAN 10 |
| 20   | Guest Wi-Fi       | VLAN 20 |
| 30   | IoT Devices       | VLAN 30 |
| 40   | Servers           | VLAN 40 |
| 50   | Management        | VLAN 50 |

> üîí All VLANs should be isolated from each other by default.


### 2. üî• Firewall Rules (Zero Trust Policy)

**Default Policy:** Deny all inter-VLAN traffic.

**Allow only:**

- **Employees VLAN (10)** ‚Üí **Servers VLAN (40)**  
  - Only on required ports (e.g., **SMB, HTTP/S, SSH**)

- **Management VLAN (50)** ‚Üí **All other VLANs**  
  - For monitoring and administrative access

- **Guest VLAN (20)** ‚Üí **Internet only**  
  - No access to internal networks

- **IoT VLAN (30)** ‚Üí **Internet only**  
  - No access to internal networks

> üö´ Deny all other cross-VLAN communication.


### 3. üõ°Ô∏è IDS/IPS Configuration

**Install and configure** either **Snort** or **Suricata** on your pfSense firewall.

**Tasks:**

- Monitor traffic across **all VLANs**
- Enable detection for:
  - Malware signatures
  - Port scans
  - Brute-force attempts
  - Suspicious payloads
- Set up **automatic blocking** for high-severity alerts
- Enable **logging of all IDS/IPS events**


### 4. üìä Logging & Monitoring

- Enable firewall and IDS/IPS logging
- Logs should be:
  - Viewable in the **pfSense dashboard**
  - Exportable to a **syslog server** or file
- Set up **alerts** for detected attacks to notify the security team


### 5. üîê Access Control

- Require **admin authentication** to access pfSense:
  - Use strong passwords or **LDAP**
  - Enable **MFA** (if feasible)
- Restrict pfSense management access to the **Management VLAN (50)** only


## üßë‚Äçüíª Student Tasks

### Network Configuration

- [ ] Create VLAN interfaces on pfSense for all 5 segments
- [ ] Assign **IP subnets** to each VLAN
- [ ] Configure **DHCP** for each VLAN

### Firewall Rules

- [ ] Implement **Zero Trust** policy:
  - Deny all inter-VLAN traffic by default
  - Allow only specified traffic between VLANs

### IDS/IPS Setup

- [ ] Install **Snort** or **Suricata**
- [ ] Choose appropriate rule sets
- [ ] Enable **detection** and **prevention**
- [ ] Configure alerting and **automatic blocking**

### Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] Enable detailed **logging** for firewall and IDS/IPS events
- [ ] Configure log **export** to syslog or local file

### Access Control

- [ ] Limit pfSense access to **Management VLAN**
- [ ] Enforce **secure login** (strong password, MFA if available)

### Testing & Documentation

- [ ] Test access **between VLANs**
- [ ] Demonstrate **blocked unauthorized traffic**
- [ ] Show detection and **logging of suspicious activity**


## ‚úÖ Deliverables

- A fully segmented network with enforced access rules
- Working IDS/IPS setup with real-time detection
- Security-focused firewall and access control policies
- Documentation showing:
  - Network layout
  - Test results
  - Screenshots of blocked/detected activity
