# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Club – General Meetings

Welcome to the **General Meetings** repository for our Cybersecurity Club!  
Here you'll find all the weekly presentation slides, lab files, notes, and instructions for our club's hands-on meetings.

## 📅 Meeting Format

Every week, our club meets for a session that includes:

- 🎤 **Presentation**: A short talk or demo on a cybersecurity topic (10–20 minutes)
- 🧪 **Hands-On Lab**: A practical activity to reinforce the topic
- 💬 **Discussion**: Open Q&A and club updates

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

Each meeting has its own folder named by topic:

Networking:
├── README.md # Overview of that week's topic
├── slides.pdf # Presentation slides
├── lab-files/ # Files needed for hands-on lab
└── notes.md # Meeting notes, discussion summaries

2. Read the `README.md` in that folder for context and instructions.
3. Open the slides and follow the lab directions.
4. If you need help, contact an officer or post in our Discord.
