# 🗓️ Weekly Meeting

## 🧠 Topic: **Intro to IR**
This week we'll learn the basics of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle with direct application through the lab.

## 🧪 Lab Instructions

📁 There is lab for this week where we will explore logs and how information gathered determines what is seen in the different phases of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle.

### 📘 Scenario Overview

You are part of your organization’s **Incident Response Team**.  
Earlier this morning, the SOC (Security Operations Center) detected **unusual web traffic** coming from a production web server (`web1`).  
Initial alerts suggested a possible **PHP upload and execution** event.

Your goal: **Analyze the logs to find indicators of compromise, then recommend appropriate steps through the incident response phases.**

⚠️ **Important:**  
Only use the lab materials in a safe, local environment. Do not host or share vulnerable files publicly.
